# ML-Cloak

Ever wonder how lucky was Harry Potter to get an invisible cloak!!! but it actually required alot of mannual work.

But as Technology is advancing Machine Learning has made it possible to  make real-time invisible cloak.

Requirments:
1) python3
2) opencv-python

IDE:
Here, I've used Anaconda Navigator-Jupyter Notebook...other IDE's can also be used but please ensure requirments are properly set.

Code:
The code is written in Python(purely) and modules used are:
1) opencv & 2) numpy.

How's:
Firstly run background.py file and it will capture the background(static) image using Webcam.

Secondly run invisible_cloak.py and it will use Webcam for live capturing all green coloured things and will overlap it with image captured in background.py, thereby, creating an illusion that all green coloured stuff will get invisible.

As per users wish they can modify it by setting the colour values in "invisible_cloak.py"....
